 Description

 ⁄⁄⁄ first think i did the Html is that i write the link inside the <head> I write link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

 ---HTML UNSOLVED---
 › the header was inside the body. it was not written the <header> it was written <div> inside the body.

 ---HTML FIXED---
 › I moved or I cut the <div> that was inside the bodythen i put it on the top then I replaced the name of the <div> to <header>,
  So if you asked me how did i know that is supposed to be <header> but not the <div>?, the answer is because the unsolved htlm the div was inside that body,
  and include the ul and li. So that mean it describe the header but not the div. The header should come first and its already include the ul and li link, then i replaced the name
  <div> to <header>. ((Conclusion))--->it was <div> inside the body then I replaced to <header> the i put it on the top not inside the body.

   # Description
  › in the css there is three section where lines that have a white color named #ffffff, so i have to condense each group into one line since they have the same parameter.
  › at line 89 i added benefit-brand, brnefit-cost to condense them into one line then, i deleted the code at line 94 to 102.
    for example...
  › .benefit-brand, benefit-lead, benefit-cost{
  margin-bottom: 32px;
  color #ffffff
  }.
  › samething with line 127 i added the other 2 section into one line at line 127 i did this,
   .search-engine-optimization, online-reputation-management, social-media-marketing{
     margin-bottom: 20px;
     padding: 50px;
     height: 300px;
